# Solidity
I challenged myself and chatgpt to suggest me 9 foundation exercises to become good at this here I will post each practice exercise every now and then
Certainly! Here are ten basic Solidity exercises and practices to help you reinforce your understanding of Solidity:



**1. Simple Calculator:**
   Create a contract that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.

**2. Token Creation:**
   Develop a basic ERC-20 token contract that allows you to create tokens, transfer them between accounts, and check balances.

**3. Voting System:**
   Build a smart contract for a simple voting system. Users can vote for different options, and the contract keeps track of the votes.

**4. Lottery Contract:**
   Create a lottery contract where users can buy tickets, and at a specified time, the contract selects a winner randomly.

**5. Splitter Contract:**
   Implement a contract that allows users to send Ether, and the contract evenly splits the Ether among multiple receivers.

**6. Escrow Service:**
   Develop an escrow smart contract that holds Ether until certain conditions are met, and then releases it to the appropriate party.

**7. Timestamp-Based Actions:**
   Create a contract that performs actions based on timestamps. For example, it could unlock certain functionality at a specific date and time.

**8. Supply Chain Tracker:**
   Design a contract that tracks the journey of a product through a supply chain, with timestamps and details at each stage.

**9. Subscription Service:**
   Build a subscription service contract where users can subscribe and pay for a service on a recurring basis, and the contract manages payments and subscription status.

These exercises cover a range of Solidity concepts and scenarios, from basic arithmetic operations to more complex smart contract functionalities. As you work on these exercises, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience and deepen your understanding of Solidity.
